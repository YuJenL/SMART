SMART Overview:

1. Software Design and Interface
SMART, developed in R with a graphical user interface (GUI), is a user-friendly software package designed for the integrated analysis of metabolomics data.

2. Workflow Integration
It streamlines the complete analytical pipeline—from data preprocessing to downstream statistical and pathway analysis—allowing users to manage and interpret complex metabolomics datasets efficiently.

3. Data Input and Visualization
SMART supports multiple data formats (e.g., .raw, .d, and mzXML) and provides visualization tools for total ion chromatograms (TICs), mass spectra, and other data features.

4. Peak Analysis and Quality Control
The software implements peak analysis for both untargeted and targeted metabolomics data, along with quality control procedures for assessing sample integrity and peak reliability.

5. Batch Effect Exploration
SMART facilitates the exploration of batch effects, including those arising from known experimental variables, latent groups (LGs), or unidentified substructures within the dataset.

6. Statistical and Multivariate Analysis
Comprehensive statistical tools are provided, including ANCOVA for group comparisons and multivariate models such as PLS and PLS-DA for dimensionality reduction and classification.

7. Pathway and Post-analysis
SMART includes modules for integrative omics pathway analysis (IOPA) and supports post-analytical tasks, including metabolite identification and calibration of concentrations.

8. Documentation
For detailed usage instructions and examples, users are encouraged to consult the SMART user guide.
