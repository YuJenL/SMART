# SMART
SMART written in R and R GUI has been developed as user-friendly software for integrated analysis of metabolomics data.

SMART streamlines the complete analysis flow from initial data preprocessing to downstream association analysis, consisting of different modules.
1.	Data Import: Analyze different data file formats (e.g., .raw, .d, and mzXML).
2.	Data Visualization: Visually represent various types of data features (e.g., total ion chromatogram (TIC) and mass spectra).
3.	Peak Analysis: Implement peak analysis for both untargeted and targeted data.
4.	Data Preprocessing: Perform data transformation and standardization.
5.	Quality Control: Conduct quality control for samples and peaks.
6.	Batch Effect Analysis: Explore batch effects (e.g., known experimental conditions, unknown latent groups (LGs), or hidden substructures).
7.	Statistical Analysis: Perform ANCOVA, PLS/PLS-DA, and conduct integrative omics pathway analysis (IOPA).
8.	Post-analysis: Complete steps such as peak identification and concentration calibration.
