# SMART
SMART written in R and R GUI has been developed as user-friendly software for integrated analysis of metabolomics data. 

SMART streamlines the complete analysis flow from initial data preprocessing to advanced downstream data analysis, consisting of the following eight modules. 
1.	Data Import: Analyze different data file formats (e.g., .raw, .d, and mzXML).
2.	Data Visualization: Visually represent various types of data features (e.g., total ion chromatogram (TIC) and mass spectra).
3.	Peak Analysis and annotation: Implement peak analysis for both untargeted and targeted data and peak annotation.
4.	Data Preprocessing: Perform data transformation and standardization.
5.	Quality Control: Conduct quality control for samples and peaks.
6.	Batch Effect Analysis: Explore batch effects (e.g., known experimental conditions, unknown latent groups (LGs), or hidden substructures).
7.	Statistical Analysis: Perform association analysis (ANCOVA), classification analysis (PLS/PLS-DA), and integrative omics pathway analysis (IOPA).
8.	Post-analysis: Execute peak identification and concentration calibration.
