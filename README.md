# SMART
SMART written in R and R GUI has been developed as user-friendly software for integrated analysis of metabolomics data.
SMART streamlines the complete analysis flow from initial data preprocessing to downstream association analysis, consisting of analyzing different data file formats (e.g., .raw, .d, and mzXML), visually representing various types of data features (e.g., total ion chromatogram (TIC) and mass spectra), implementing peak analysis for both untargeted data and target data, conducting quality control for samples and peaks, exploring batch effects (e.g., known experimental conditions, unknown latent groups (LGs), or hidden substructures),  performing statistical analysis (ANCOVA, PLS/PLS-DA) and integrative omics pathway analysis (IOPA), and accomplish post analysis including peak identification and concentration calibration.
